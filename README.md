# RGB-D-Hand-Tracking-Pipeline-for-Blender
This project implements an RGB-D–based hand tracking pipeline using Intel RealSense a camera D415 to capture 3D hand landmarks in real time. The captured landmark data is transmitted over a modem connection to a second computer, where Blender receives and processes the incoming stream.
